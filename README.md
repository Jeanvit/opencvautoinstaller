# About 

This is an auto compilation/installation script for OpenCV4.1 . It will create a clean ~/opencv folder, download all required dependencies and OpenCV & Contrib zips. It will also extract and make them. This script is to make new OpenCV installations on Linux systems easier, and it won't check for errors during the process. 


# How to use

- run on your terminal:

```
cd ~ 
git clone https://github.com/Jeanvit/opencvautoinstaller.git
